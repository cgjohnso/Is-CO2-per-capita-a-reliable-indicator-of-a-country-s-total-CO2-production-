# Scrutinizing The World Bank Climate Action Plan


## Business Problem

To combat climate change, the World Bank has set a goal in its Climate Action Plan 2021-2025 to focus resources on reducing emissions from high CO2 per capita emitting countries. I review the global CO2 emissions dataset to determine if this strategy will have the intended outcomes of reducing global greenhouse gases.


Tools used in this project are:
+	Tableau Desktop
+	Microsoft Excel
+ Microsoft Powerpoint
+ YouTube



## Data Set

- Cleaned World Bank CO2 Emissions dataset provided by Google. - [Download](https://github.com/cgjohnso/Is-CO2-per-capita-a-reliable-indicator-of-a-countrys-total-CO2-production/blob/main/CO2-Dataset.xlsx).

- World Bank CO2 Emissions Per Capita, updated 2/5/2016 - [Download](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)

- World Bank Total CO2 Production, updated 2/5/2016 - [Download](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT)

## Research Questions

To measure the effectiveness of the strategy, I focused on determining the contribution to global CO2 emissions made by specific blocs of countries through developing the following research questions:

1. What is the total CO2 production for the top 10 emitting countries?
2. What is the total CO2 production for the top 10 emitting countries by CO2 per capita?
3. What is the total CO2 production for all other countries combined minus the top 10 emitters by total C02 production, and the top 10 emitting countries by CO2 per capita?


## Results

I loaded the World Bank's CO2 Dataset into Tableau, and created a visualization that segmented countries into categories based on emission levels. A power point was created, and a final analysis of the data was performed via a narrarated presentation that was uploaded to Youtube.

## Insights

1. The top 10 emitting countries by total CO2 production account for 71% of all global CO2 emissions
2. The top 10 emitting countries by CO2 per capita account for 3% of all global CO2 emissions
3. All other countries combined minus the top 10 emitting countries by total CO2 production, and the top 10 emitting countries by CO2 per capita account for 25% of all global CO2 emissions

## Recommendations

1. Don't use CO2 per capita as a metric to determine where to allocate funds, and attention as countries with high per capita CO2 contribute the least to global CO2 levels. 
2. For highest return on investment, establish policies, and direct resources to reach out to the top 10 emitting countries by Total CO2 production as these countries contribute the vast majority of CO2 emissions.
