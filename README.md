# Is CO2 per capita a reliable indicator of a country's total CO2 production?
Dashboard project created as part of week three reading assignments in Course 6 of the [Google Data Analytics Certification](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none).

## Background

The assignment requested an exploratory data analysis be performed using a provided World Bank CO2 Emissions dataset, and a dashboard created from any insights obtained from that dataset. The precleaned dataset was imported into Tableau, and after reviewing several trends, a dashboard was created comparing two metrics from the dataset: CO2 per capita and total CO2 production, and later integrated into a powerpoint presentation.
